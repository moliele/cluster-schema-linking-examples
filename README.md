# cluster-schema-linking-examples

Examples of cluster and schema linking.

## [source-to-destination](source-to-destination/)

The idea of this demo is to create a source cluster and a destination cluster, the `product` schema and data are created in the source cluster/schema registry and it is replicated to the destination cluster using schema and cluster linking. We make use of schema contexts to isolate subjects and topic prefixing.
